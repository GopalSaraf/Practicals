### [Sorting and searching](https://github.com/GopalSaraf/SE_Labs/blob/main/DSAL/sortingAndSearching.cpp)

Consider a student database of SEIT class (at least 15 records). 
Database contains different fields of every student like Roll No, Name and SGPA. (array of structure)  
a. Design a roll call list, arrange list of students according to roll numbers in ascending order (Use Bubble Sort)  
b. Arrange list of students alphabetically. (Use Insertion sort)  
c. Arrange list of students to find out first ten toppers from a class. (Use Quick sort)  
d. Search students according to SGPA. If more than one student having same SGPA, then print list of all students having same SGPA.  
e. Search a particular student according to name using binary search without recursion. (All the student records having the presence of search key should be displayed)  

(Note: Implement either Bubble sort or Insertion Sort.)
