| [Classes and object](Assignment1) |                                                                                                                                                                                    Design a class ‘Complex’ with data members for real and imaginary part. Provide default and parameterized constructors. Write a program to perform arithmetic operations of two complex numbers.                                                                                                                                                                                    |
|    [Inheritance](Assignment2)     | Design and develop inheritance for a given case study, identify objects and relationships and implement inheritance wherever applicable. Employee class has Emp_name, Emp_id, Address, Mail_id, and Mobile_no as members. Inherit the classes: Programmer, Team Lead, Assistant Project Manager and Project Manager from employee class. Add Basic Pay (BP) as the member of all the inherited classes with 97% of BP as DA, 10 % of BP as HRA, 12% of BP as PF, 0.1% of BP for staff club fund. Generate pay slips for the employees with their gross and net salary. |
|    [Polymorphism](Assignment3)    |                                                                               Identify commonalities and differences between Publication, Book and Magazine classes. Title, Price, Copies are common instance variables and saleCopy is common method. The differences are, Book class has author and orderCopies. Magazine Class has orderQty, Currentissue, reciveissue. Write a program to find how many copies of the given books are ordered and display total sale of publication.                                                                               |
|  [Dynamic Binding](Assignment4)   |                                                      Design a base class shape with two double type values and member functions to input the data and compute_area() for calculating area of figure. Derive two classes’ triangle and rectangle. Make compute_area() as abstract function and redefine this function in the derived class to suit their requirements. Write a program that accepts dimensions of triangle/rectangle and display calculated area. Implement dynamic binding for given case study.                                                       |
|     [Interface](Assignment5)      |                                                                   Design and develop a context for given case study and implement an interface for Vehicles Consider the example of vehicles like bicycle, car, and bike. All Vehicles have common functionalities such as Gear Change, Speed up and apply breaks . Make an interface and put all these common functionalities. Bicycle, Bike, Car classes should be implemented for all these functionalities in their own class in their own way.                                                                    |
|  Case Study - [Banking](Banking)  |                                                                                                                                          Using concepts of Object Oriented programming develop solution of Banking system having following operations : <br> 1. Create an account <br> 2. Deposit money <br> 3. Withdraw money <br> 4. Daily withdrawal limit <br> 5. Check the balance <br> 6. Display Account information.                                                                                                                                           |
